  <h1>Table Tennis Points Tally</h1>

  <p>In table tennis, points are tallied using a simple system. The first player or team to reach a certain number of points wins the game.</p>

  <h2>Scoring System</h2>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Points</th>
        <th>Outcome</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Love</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>15</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>40</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Game</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>In a standard table tennis game, players or teams serve two points each, alternating serves after every two points. The first player or team to reach four points wins the game, unless the score is tied at 3-3. In that case, the game continues until one player or team wins by a margin of two points.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>Let's say Player A and Player B are playing a table tennis match. The score is currently 3-2 in favor of Player A.</p>

  <p>If Player A wins the next point, the score becomes 4-2 and Player A wins the game. If Player B wins the next point, the score becomes 3-3, and they continue playing until one player wins by a margin of two points.</p>
